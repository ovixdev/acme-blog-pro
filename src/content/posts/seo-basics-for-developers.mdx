# SEO Basics Every Developer Should Know

As a developer, you might think SEO is just a marketing concern. But many SEO fundamentals are actually technical.

## Why Developers Should Care About SEO

Your beautifully crafted website is useless if no one can find it. SEO bridges the gap between great code and great visibility.

## Technical SEO Fundamentals

### 1. Semantic HTML

Use the right HTML elements for the right purpose:

```html
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>Page Title</h1>
  </header>
  <main>Content here</main>
</article>
```

### 2. Meta Tags

Every page needs proper meta tags:

- Title tag (under 60 characters)
- Meta description (under 160 characters)
- Open Graph tags for social sharing

### 3. Performance

Google uses page speed as a ranking factor. Focus on:

- Optimizing images
- Minimizing JavaScript
- Using CDNs

### 4. Mobile-First

More than 50% of web traffic is mobile. Your site must be responsive.

## Quick Wins

1. Add alt text to all images
2. Use descriptive URLs
3. Create an XML sitemap
4. Implement structured data
