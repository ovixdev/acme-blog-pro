# Why TypeScript Matters for Your Business

If you're building software, TypeScript deserves your attention.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds static typing.

```typescript
// TypeScript catches errors early
function greet(name: string) {
  return name.toUpperCase();
}

greet(123); // Error: Argument must be a string
```

## Business Benefits

### 1. Fewer Bugs in Production

Type checking catches bugs during development, not in production.

### 2. Better Developer Experience

Autocomplete, refactoring tools, and inline documentation boost productivity.

### 3. Easier Onboarding

Types serve as documentation that never goes out of date.

### 4. Safer Refactoring

TypeScript tells you exactly what breaks when you change something.

## Our Recommendation

For any project lasting more than a few months, TypeScript is worth the investment.
